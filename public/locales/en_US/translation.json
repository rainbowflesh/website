The device disrupts and counters UAVs by emitting specific frequency electromagnetic waves, thereby blocking the communication or navigation links of the UAV and achieving rapid target diversion or forced landing. This product provides real-time display of counteraction modes, battery levels, and other information. It can be used independently or combined with UAV detection products to form a \"Detect'n Strike\" system.",
